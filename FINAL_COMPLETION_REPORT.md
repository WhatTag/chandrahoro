1. Profile update endpoint (`PUT /api/v1/auth/profile`)
2. Password change endpoint (`POST /api/v1/auth/change-password`)
3. Export data endpoint (`GET /api/v1/auth/export-data`)
4. Delete account endpoint (`DELETE /api/v1/auth/account`)

### Placeholder Features
- Export data button (needs backend)
- Delete account button (needs backend)
- Make charts public toggle (needs backend)
