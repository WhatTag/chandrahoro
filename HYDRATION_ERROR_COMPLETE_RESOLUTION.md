## What You Need to Do NOW

### Step 1: Hard Refresh Browser (CRITICAL)
This clears the old cached version from your browser.

**On Mac:**
```
Cmd + Shift + R
```

**On Windows/Linux:**
```
Ctrl + Shift + R
```

### Step 2: Open Browser Console
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Press F12 (or Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
3. Go to Console tab

### Step 3: Check for Errors
**You should see:**
- ✅ NO "Hydration failed" messages
- ✅ NO "Expected server HTML to contain a matching `<a>`" warnings
- ✅ NO nested anchor tag warnings
- ⚠️ Only the harmless "fetchPriority" warning is acceptable

### Step 4: Test Navigation
1. Click logo (top left) → Should navigate to home
2. Click "Features" link → Should scroll to features section
3. Click "Pricing" link → Should scroll to pricing section
4. Click "Home" link → Should navigate to /landing
5. Click "Sign in" button → Should navigate to /login
6. All should work WITHOUT hydration errors

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Hard refreshed browser (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
- [ ] Opened DevTools Console
- [ ] No hydration errors in console
- [ ] Clicked logo - navigated to home
- [ ] Clicked "Features" link - scrolled to section
- [ ] Clicked "Pricing" link - scrolled to section
- [ ] Clicked "Home" link - navigated to /landing
- [ ] Clicked "Sign in" button - navigated to /login
- [ ] All buttons work without errors

## If You Still See Errors

1. **Try a harder refresh:**
   - Windows: Ctrl+Shift+Delete (opens cache clearing dialog)
   - Mac: Cmd+Shift+Delete (opens cache clearing dialog)
   - Select "All time" and clear cache

2. **Or restart the dev server:**
   ```bash
   # In the terminal running the frontend server
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop
   # Then run:
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Then hard refresh browser again**

## Summary of Changes

### BrandMark.tsx
- Removed Link import
- Changed Link wrapper to div with onClick handler
- Added keyboard support (Enter/Space keys)
- Added role="button" and tabIndex for accessibility

### MainNav.tsx
- Hash links (#features, #pricing, etc.) now use `<a>` tags
- Page links (/landing) still use Link components
- Conditional rendering based on href

### Footer.tsx
- Hash links (#features, #pricing, etc.) now use `<a>` tags
- Page links (/about, /blog, etc.) still use Link components
- Conditional rendering based on href

## Root Cause Summary

The hydration errors were caused by:
1. **BrandMark using Link component** - Created nested anchor tags
2. **MainNav using Link for hash navigation** - Link is for page routes, not hash links
3. **Footer using Link for hash navigation** - Same issue as MainNav

## Prevention for Future

**Never use Next.js Link component for:**
- Hash navigation (#section)
- Logo/branding navigation (use div + onClick)
- Wrapping other interactive elements

**Always use Link for:**
- Page navigation (/path)
- Text links to other pages
