## ⚠️ Critical Issues Found (3)

### Issue #1: No Authentication in Frontend ⚠️ BLOCKING
**Problem:** Users cannot save charts to database  
**Root Cause:** No login/register pages, no JWT token handling  
**Impact:** Cannot test authenticated endpoints  
**Solution:** Implement auth flow (2-3 hours)

### Issue #2: Charts Not Persisted to Database ⚠️ BLOCKING
**Problem:** Charts calculated but not saved  
**Root Cause:** Chart endpoint doesn't save to DB  
**Impact:** Charts lost after page refresh  
**Solution:** Modify chart calculation (1-2 hours)

### Issue #3: No User Registration/Login UI ⚠️ BLOCKING
**Problem:** Cannot authenticate users  
**Root Cause:** Missing login/register pages  
**Impact:** Cannot test user workflows  
**Solution:** Create auth pages (2-3 hours)
