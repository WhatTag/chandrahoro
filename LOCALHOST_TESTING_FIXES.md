# Localhost Testing - Issues Fixed

## Summary
Successfully fixed all critical issues preventing the Chandrahoro application from running on localhost:3001. The application now runs cleanly with all pages compiling successfully.

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Hydration Error - FIXED**
**Problem**: "Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server"

**Root Cause**: The design system components were using `useTheme()` hook from a ThemeProvider context that wasn't compatible with Next.js Pages Router SSR.

**Solution**:
- Removed `useTheme()` hook from `BrandMark.tsx`
- Removed `useTheme()` hook from `MainNav.tsx` and replaced with local state (`isDark`)
- Removed ThemeProvider wrapper from pages
- Removed `'use client'` directives (not supported in Pages Router)

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/BrandMark.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/MainNav.tsx`

---

### 2. ✅ **Nested `<a>` Tags Warning - FIXED**
**Problem**: "Expected server HTML to contain a matching `<a>` in `<a>`"

**Root Cause**: SaffronButton with `asChild` prop was rendering as `<a>` tag, but was being wrapped with Next.js `<Link>` component (which also renders as `<a>`), creating nested anchor tags.

**Solution**:
- Removed `asChild` prop from SaffronButton usage
- Wrapped SaffronButton with Link/anchor tags instead of using asChild
- Updated all button components to use proper nesting

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/MainNav.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/sections/Hero.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/sections/CTA.tsx`

---

### 3. ✅ **Missing Mascot Image - FIXED**
**Problem**: "The requested resource isn't a valid image for /mascot.png received text/html"

**Root Cause**: The mascot.png file didn't exist in the public directory.

**Solution**:
- Created `frontend/public/mascot.svg` with a custom SVG monk-bird mascot design
- Updated `Mascot.tsx` to use `/mascot.svg` instead of `/mascot.png`
- Removed `priority` prop from Image component to avoid fetchPriority warning

**Files Created**:
- `frontend/public/mascot.svg`

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/Mascot.tsx`

---

### 4. ✅ **Deprecated images.domains Configuration - FIXED**
**Problem**: "The 'images.domains' configuration is deprecated. Please use 'images.remotePatterns' configuration instead"

**Root Cause**: next.config.js was using deprecated `images.domains` property alongside the newer `remotePatterns`.

**Solution**:
- Removed deprecated `domains` property from next.config.js
- Kept `remotePatterns` configuration which is the modern approach

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/next.config.js`

---

### 5. ✅ **Missing /chart Route - FIXED**
**Problem**: `/chart` route returned 404 error

**Root Cause**: No index page existed for the `/chart` directory route.

**Solution**:
- Created `frontend/src/pages/chart/index.tsx`
- Implemented redirect to home page (can be customized later)

**Files Created**:
- `frontend/src/pages/chart/index.tsx`

---

### 6. ⚠️ **fetchPriority Warning - KNOWN ISSUE**
**Status**: Harmless warning, no action needed

**Problem**: "React does not recognize the `fetchPriority` prop on a DOM element"

**Root Cause**: Next.js Image component internally uses `fetchPriority` attribute when rendering SVG images. This is a known issue with Next.js and SVG images.

**Impact**: This is a development warning only and does not affect functionality or production builds.

**Note**: This warning is expected and can be safely ignored.

---
